# DRIFT LOG (append-only)

The human reads this FIRST every session. The agent appends here whenever it blocks, parks for a visual gate, needs a contract change, or averts a deviation. Entry format is defined in 02_WORKFLOW.md §3. Never delete entries; resolve them by adding a follow-up entry.

## [2026-06-06] — M1.1
TYPE: PARKED-FOR-VISUAL
WHAT I WAS DOING: Building the M1.1 skeleton — gdext crate + WorldRoot node + .gdextension + demo scene; proving the Rust↔Godot bridge and hot reload.
WHAT HAPPENED: Bridge works end-to-end, and the rebuild→reload mechanism is now verified programmatically (not just eyeballed):
  - RUN 1 (headless) printed `WG13 WorldRoot ready — Rust bridge live (M1.1).` → extension loads, `WorldRoot` registers, `_ready` fires.
  - Then edited the string to `[reload-test v2]`, `cargo build`, RUN 2 (headless) printed the NEW string → Godot loads the freshly rebuilt DLL after a source change. Reverted the string and rebuilt clean.
  - REMAINING (narrow): each run is a fresh process, so this proves "rebuilt DLL loads on next run," not literal in-editor live swap (gdext `reloadable=true` replacing the lib while the editor process stays open). That last nicety is a ~10s desk check; the substance of the gate (Rust runs in Godot; your edits take effect after rebuild) is proven.
TWO FINDINGS WORTH KNOWING (now in 01_TOOLCHAIN.md §1/§3):
  1. A global `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=D:\cargo-target-kalshi` env var (another project's) overrides `.cargo/config.toml` and sends our build out of the tree. Build commands now pin `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=rust/target`.
  2. A fresh project has no `.godot/extension_list.cfg`, so a plain game run fails with `Cannot get class 'WorldRoot'`. Fixed by an editor import scan: `--headless --editor --import`. Documented as a required first-time step.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS GATE (human, at desk):
  - Open the project in the Godot 4.6.2 editor: `& $env:GODOT --path "D:\world gen 13\wg-13"` (or just launch the editor and open it).
  - Run the project (F5). Confirm `WG13 WorldRoot ready — Rust bridge live (M1.1).` appears in the Output/console.
  - With the editor still open, change that string in `rust/gdext/src/lib.rs`, rebuild (`$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR="D:\world gen 13\rust\target"; cargo build --manifest-path "D:\world gen 13\rust\Cargo.toml"`), run again, and confirm the NEW string appears WITHOUT having restarted the editor. That is the hot-reload pass.
EXACT ERROR / STATE: none — green and compiling.
MY HYPOTHESIS: gate should pass; gdext `reloadable = true` is set and 0.5.3 supports hot reload.
CODEBASE STATE: green at the M1.1 commit (see git log).
WHAT I DID NOT DO: Did not start M1.2. Did not self-certify the visual gate. Did not change the contract.
